Problem Statement:

1. Use the package RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR.
data(RcmdrTestDrive)
and perform the below operations:

a. Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.
Answer-
library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
View(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
library(dplyr)
RcmdrTestDrive %>% 
  group_by(Smoking_Status = RcmdrTestDrive$smoking, Gender = RcmdrTestDrive$gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary))


b. Which gender has the highest mean salary?
Answer-
library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
View(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
library(dplyr)
Highest_Mean_Salary <- as.data.frame(RcmdrTestDrive %>%
                                       group_by(Gender = RcmdrTestDrive$gender) %>%
                                       summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary)))
Highest_Mean_Salary[which.max(Highest_Mean_Salary$mean_salary),]

# Gender Male has the highest mean salary

c. Report the highest mean salary.
Answer-
library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
View(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
library(dplyr)
RcmdrTestDrive %>% 
  group_by(Smoking_Status = RcmdrTestDrive$smoking, Gender = RcmdrTestDrive$gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_salary))

# The highest mean salary(which is of Gender = Male as per above answer) is 743.3.

d. Compare the spreads for the genders by calculating the standard deviation of salary by gender.
Answer-
library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
library(dplyr)
RcmdrTestDrive %>%group_by(Gender = RcmdrTestDrive$gender) %>%
                                       summarise(sd_salary = sd(salary))

# Table for the standard deviation of salary on the basis of Gender.
  Gender sd_salary
1 Female      131.
2 Male        159

# The Standard Deviation of the Male mean salary is more than the Female mean salary. Hence the spread of the Male salary
is more than the Female salary.
